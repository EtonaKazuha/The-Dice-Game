The Dice Game 

How to play:
A game that is purely random. Two players compete by each of them picking 
one of the two dice on screen. Once you refresh the page, the dice will 
role. Whoever gets the highest number wins.

How it work:
The JavaScript Code first generates a random number between 1 and 6 for 
both die. Then it checks if the first player's die was higher than the 
second and determines if first player wins. If the first players value is 
not higher than the second player, it checks if the second player has a 
higher value and determines if they win. If the second player does not win, 
then it is a draw.
